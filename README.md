# spatial

A library for working with blocks in space. No, not that Space.

More stuff to come soon as I drag things out of the other Compact mods and centralize it here. Pull Requests for adding similar functionality encouraged!

## Useful stuff
- `AABBHelper` - has utilities for calculating corners of AABB instances, normalizing AABB instances to zero/other instances, and writing the data out to a string in a less-painful way.
